Running Tracker
my program works to keep a record of multiple peoples runs

one simply has to go on the runs page and add a run;
enter the day of your run,
enter your name,
enter the ditance of your run in kilomiters (integers only, no floats),
enter the duration(time) of your run in seconds, multiply minute amount by 60 to get seconds,
enter the average speed of your run,
hit submit, 
cancel if you would not like to make an entry

the table will then store your record on the running tab
if you would like to make some changes, click the edit button and it will take you to a page to make changes
once you are satisfied click submit or if you would like to abort the operation click cancel
if you would like to delete an entry, click the delete button,
a website popup will ask if you are sure, click yes

Thank you for using my website!
